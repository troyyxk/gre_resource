我从事 GRE 教学 10 年有余，遥想当年我们在准备 GRE 考试时抱着厚重的红宝书（俞敏洪先⽣
的《GRE 词汇精选》）⼀遍又⼀遍苦读，不禁感慨时代在变，我们对于 GRE 考试的看法和要
求也在改变。顺势者昌。2014 年底我们出版了《GRE 词汇⼀本通》第⼀版，⾄今已经过了三年
多。在上海新东⽅校区试⽤的过程中，本书得到了绝⼤部分学⽣的好评。但是新东⽅集团不满

⾜于⼀个城市、⼀本书的效果，我们编委也不敢故步⾃封，所以有了这本改版后的《GRE 核⼼
词汇⼀本通》。

此次改版我们做了很多战略性和内容上的调整：

1.名师荟萃

本书借新东⽅集团之⼒，找到了⼀批 GRE 语⽂ 160 分以上甚⾄是满分的⽼师，他们从事⼀线教
学⼯作，最接近学⽣，了解学⽣需求，由这样的⽼师共同编写本书。

2.全⾯精炼

在改版之后，《GRE 核⼼词汇⼀本通》 从原来的 600 多页瘦⾝成 300 页不到，词条 2314 个

（另外有阅读词条 127 个），是现在市⾯上词汇量最少⽽同时选词又最准确的 GRE 词汇书之

⼀。这次专门包括了阅读单词（最后⼀个 list）；⽽填空单词只来⾃于最新的真题，其他来源的
单词全部从本书中去除，最⼤可能提升本书的效⼒；近反义词只选取题⽬⾥⾯考查过的同反义
词，凡是没有在新题⾥⾯考过的，⼀个不留，全部从本书中去除，尽可能降低同学背诵本书的
难度。

3.准确⾼效

本书在编写过程中⼤量参考了《⽜津⾼阶英汉双解词典》、《朗⽂当代⾼级英语词典》、以及

《英汉⼤词典》等权威词典中的中⽂释义，以确保释义准确、简洁、符合汉语规范，尽可能没
有歧义。

选取例句时为了保证能够让同学尽快确定单词的⽤法，部分引⽤了上海译⽂出版社出版的《英
汉⼤词典》（第⼆版）的例句，不再使⽤翻译不确定，虽然很精美但是阅读费劲的句⼦。因为
我们意识到， 尽快解决学⽣的痛点，才是 GRE 词汇书的第⼀要务。

4.重视基础

我们去掉了原版最后的六级简单词汇表，因为我们上课使⽤本书时发现，很多六级所考查的单
词有不少同学并不认识，所以就算是六级单词我们也⼀并放⼊本书的核⼼词汇中。


5.使⽤⽅便

第⼀版《GRE 词汇⼀本通》是乱序的，但是没有加⼊索引，同学们反映使⽤起来查询不⽅便，
因此本次更新加⼊了索引。并且，原词和衍⽣词会放在⼀起，⽐如 tedious 和 tedium，construe
和 misconstrue 等 放在⼀起，⽅便同学记忆。

6.直击痛点

本书中将共 162 个所谓的简单单词专门标记为“熟词僻义”。因为我们在上课时发现，部分题⽬
学⽣之所以理解错误，往往不是由于不认识⽐较⽣僻的词汇，⽽是简单单词有学⽣不了解的意
思，导致整个句⼦理解出错。⽐如 return 是“回报”的意思，不是“回来”；ground 是“领域”或者
“原因”的意思。

7.上下统⼀

本书由新东⽅集团统⼀使⽤，所有新东⽅学校的 GRE 课程（线上线下）都会使⽤该书作为词汇
教材。

8.⽤好时间

本书内容会在“乐词 app”同步上线，让学⽣能够更好地利⽤零碎时间背单词。

作为本书总策划和编写者之⼀，我在此想要感谢集团和各个分校同事的⼤⼒⽀持。感谢集团国
外考试推⼴中⼼的刘烁旸⽼师、王⼩丹⽼师对于本书第⼀版和第⼆版的肯定和⽀持，这也是上
海团队能够担纲本书的原因；感谢武汉学校的冷楠⽼师花了⼤量的时间编写、校对本书的内
容，他在《新 SAT 词汇精选》上的⼯作经验和 GRE 考试的⾼分是我们这本书能够顺利成书的
保障；感谢天津学校光兆辉⽼师的⽀持和帮助，在筛选词汇和后期审定上花了很多功夫；感谢
上海团队周⾠、刘天⽻和邓静⽼师的⾟勤编写，希望我们⼀直愉快合作；感谢武汉学校的徐格

⽼师在阅读选词和后期审校上的⾟勤⼯作；感谢上海学校美研项⽬的陶静⽼师、丁甲⽼师和美
本项⽬的许梅杰⽼师在后期审校和编订上的⾟勤⼯作；感谢武汉学校的杜璟⽼师在内容整合过
程中的帮助。

最后引⽤⼀段《⽜津英汉⾼阶词典》（第七版）译者李北达教授的前⾔，聊以⾃励。

“编译⼯作择其要者，⾄少应包括以下⼏点：准确译出原⽂定义，选出贴切对应词，不加进原⽂
没有的成分，排除可能误解英语的歧义，排除可能误解汉语的歧义，使⽤规范的汉语词语⽽不
污染汉语。从汉语⾓度出发，还包括修订原⽂不⾜之处及协助词典使⽤者正确运⽤汉语。英汉
词典的译⽂应做到在汉语⼯具书中有据可查。只要将读者的需要和困难放在⼼中，在翻译的基
础上对原语和译语做⼤量艰苦细致的查证修订⼯作，词典编译是⼤有可为的。”——李北达

只要把学⽣的困难放在⼼中，做⼤量的学习和艰苦细致的查证修订⼯作，本书编写也是⼤有可
为的。
